📚 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ReadMe

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ReadMe! 😄

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, representing real-world entities with attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). 🌍💻

Here are the exciting topics covered in this ReadMe:

1️⃣ Classes & Objects 🏗️
   Learn about creating classes and objects to represent entities in your program.

2️⃣ This, Final, Finalize Method, and Constructors 🤝
   Discover the power of 'this' keyword, understand finalization process, and explore constructors.

3️⃣ New, Wrapper Class, and Garbage Collection 🗑️
   Dive into the 'new' keyword, handle primitive data types using wrapper classes, and understand garbage collection.

4️⃣ Static Keyword In Java ⚡
   Explore the concept of static members and their significance in Java.

5️⃣ More About Static, Inner Classes, and Singleton Class 🏢
   Learn advanced concepts related to static members, inner classes, and the Singleton design pattern.

6️⃣ Principles of OOPs - Inheritance 🔄
   Understand inheritance, a key principle in OOP, and learn how to create hierarchical relationships between classes.

7️⃣ Principles of OOPs - Polymorphism 🦜
   Discover the power of polymorphism and learn how to write flexible code that can work with different object types.

8️⃣ Principles of OOPs - Abstraction and Encapsulation 🏛️🔒
   Explore abstraction and encapsulation, two fundamental concepts that promote code modularity and data protection.

9️⃣ Access Control, In-built Packages, Object Class 🔒📦
   Learn about access control mechanisms, utilize in-built packages, and understand the Object class.

🔟 Abstract Class & Intro of Interfaces 🖼️🔗
   Dive into abstract classes, which provide a blueprint for subclasses, and get an introduction to interfaces.

1️⃣1️⃣ Interfaces - A Deep Dive 🌊
   Explore interfaces in depth, their purpose, implementation, and how they promote code flexibility.

Feel free to dive into any topic that interests you the most! 🏊‍♂️

Happy learning and enjoy your journey into the world of Object-Oriented Programming! 🚀🔥
