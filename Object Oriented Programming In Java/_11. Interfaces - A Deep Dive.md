## Java Interfaces

#### What is an Interface in Java?

- An **interface** in Java is a collection of abstract methods that define a contract for classes implementing the interface.
- Interfaces specify what a class can do, without specifying how it does it.
- By default, interface methods are public and abstract, and variables are final and static.
- An interface can be implemented by multiple classes, allowing for multiple inheritance of behavior.
- Interfaces provide a way to achieve polymorphism and dynamic method resolution.
- Interfaces can also have default methods (with a body) and static methods starting from Java 8.
- Variables declared in an interface are implicitly public, static, and final.
- Interfaces allow for full abstraction of a class interface from its implementation.

#### Key Points about Interfaces:

1. **Declaration**:
   ```java
   public interface Animal {
       void eat();
       void sleep();
   }
   ```

2. **Implementation**:
   - A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface.
   - A class uses the `implements` keyword to implement an interface.

   ```java
   public class Dog implements Animal {
       @Override
       public void eat() {
           System.out.println("Dog is eating");
       }

       @Override
       public void sleep() {
           System.out.println("Dog is sleeping");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **No Default or Static Methods**:
   - In this example, we will not use default or static methods.
   - All methods in the interface are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.

#### Example:

```java
// Define the interface
public interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

// Implement the interface in a class
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog is sleeping");
    }
}

// Test the implementation
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat();
        dog.sleep();
    }
}
```

#### Definitions:

1. **Default Methods**:
   - Introduced in Java 8.
   - Allow methods to have a body inside the interface.
   - Provide a default implementation that classes can inherit or override.

   ```java
   public interface Animal {
       default void eat() {
           System.out.println("Eating");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Static Methods**:
   - Introduced in Java 8.
   - Allow defining static methods in interfaces.
   - These methods belong to the interface class and not to the instance of the class.

   ```java
   public interface Animal {
       static void commonBehavior() {
           System.out.println("Common behavior for all animals");
       }
   }
   ```

By understanding these core concepts, you can effectively use interfaces in Java to enforce method implementation contracts across different classes without relying on default or static methods.
### Accessing Static and Default Methods in Java Interfaces

#### 1. **Static Methods**:
Static methods in an interface can be accessed directly using the interface name. They are not inherited by implementing classes and can only be called on the interface itself.

#### 2. **Default Methods**:
Default methods can be called on instances of implementing classes. They provide a default implementation that can be overridden by the implementing class.

#### Define an Interface with Default and Static Methods

```java
public interface Animal {
    // Default method
    default void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }

    // Static method
    static void commonBehavior() {
        System.out.println("Common behavior for all animals");
    }

    // Abstract method
    void sleep();
}
```

#### Implement the Interface in a Class

```java
public class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Dog is sleeping");
    }

    // Override the default method
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating");
    }
}
```

#### Access the Methods

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of Dog
        Animal dog = new Dog();

        // Call the default method (overridden by Dog class)
        dog.eat();  // Output: Dog is eating

        // Call the abstract method implemented by Dog class
        dog.sleep();  // Output: Dog is sleeping

        // Call the static method on the interface
        Animal.commonBehavior();  // Output: Common behavior for all animals
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Default Methods**: Called on instances of the implementing class. They can be overridden.
- **Static Methods**: Called on the interface itself. They cannot be overridden.

### Output:
```
Dog is eating
Dog is sleeping
Common behavior for all animals
```
